You are now solving the problem using the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategy. This method involves breaking the problem into smaller logical steps and solving them one by one in a sequential manner.

### Instructions:
1. Decompose the problem into substeps and explain what information is needed at each stage.
2. Perform reasoning step-by-step to move toward the solution.
3. Clearly describe your intermediate thinking process.
4. At the end, provide a single sentence that presents your final answer.

### Output Format
